# JavaMao
JavaMao is a Java-based desktop application which is an implementation of the card game Mao (also called the Game of Mao).
JavaMao has cross-network and LAN multiplayer support and a built-in rule making language called Mao Scripting Language (MSL).

# How do I play it?
Due to there being lots of updates and the game not being complete at this time, there is not an executable JAR file.
However, you can clone this repository and then build and run it using your IDE of choice.

# What are the rules of Mao?
I cannot tell you, as this would violate the one rules of the game, specifically this one:
> "The only rule I can tell you is this one."

For the purposes of this readme, though, I'll also tell you that when somebody wins the game, they are allowed to create a new rule.
If you really wanted to know the rest of the rules, though, you can look at the .mao files within the [rules folder](/rules).

# How are rules created?
JavaMao has a built-in interpreter for its own DSL called Mao Scripting Language (MSL).
MSL is the way to create simple or complicated rules in an easily readable manner at runtime.

# Documentation
For documentation on MSL, please look at the [JavaMao wiki](https://github.com/TitaniumSapphire/JavaMao/wiki). You can also look at the default rules of Mao in the [rules folder](/rules) for inspiration.
